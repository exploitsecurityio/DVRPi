# Damn Vulnerable Raspberry Pi (DVRPi)

## Overview

Damn Vulnerable Raspberry Pi (DVRPi) is a Raspberry Pi 4B firmware designed to teach hardware hacking through intentional vulnerabilities. The Unsecured UART Console challenge introduces learners to serial communication and physical interface exploitation, a common entry point for attacking embedded devices like IoT systems, routers, and industrial controllers.

Warning: DVRPi is for educational use only. Do not deploy on production or internet-facing systems, as it contains intentional vulnerabilities that will lead to compromise.
