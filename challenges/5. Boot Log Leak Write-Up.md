# Boot Log Leak Challenge

## Overview
**Challenge Name**: Boot Log Leak  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Category**: Forensics  
**Goal**: Find an MD5 hash hidden in the system’s syslogs and utilise this to decrypt the hidden archive.

The **Damn Vulnerable Raspberry Pi (DVRPi)** accidentally leaks sensitive information in its syslog logs, a mistake often seen in embedded devices. Your job is to connect to the device through its serial console, check the logs, and pull out an MD5 hash to be used as authentication to a hidden archive that exposes the flag. 

## What You’ll Need
- A UART-to-USB adapter to connect to the DVRPi’s serial console (GPIO14, GPIO15) (pins 8 and 10 for TX/RX, pin 6 for ground); set to 115200 baud, 8N1).
- A terminal emulator like `minicom`, `screen`, or PuTTY on your computer.
- Basic Linux command-line knowledge (e.g., using `grep`, `curl`).

## Challenge Description
When the DVRPi boots up, it logs an MD5 hash to its kernel and system logs. This hash is part of a flag in a specific format. Your steps are:

1. Connect to the DVRPi using its UART serial console.
2. Find the MD5 hash in the logs with `dmesg` or `/var/log/syslog`.

This challenge shows how sensitive data, like cryptographic hashes, can be exposed in logs if a system isn’t configured properly.

## How to Solve It
Here’s how to tackle the Boot Log Leak challenge:

1. **Connect to the DVRPi via UART**:
   - Hook up a UART-to-USB adapter to your DVRPi’s GPIO pins:
     - **TX (GPIO 8, pin 8)** to the adapter’s RX.
     - **RX (GPIO 10, pin 10)** to the adapter’s TX.
     - **Ground (pin 4)** to the adapter’s ground.
   - Set up your terminal emulator (e.g., `minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200` or `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`) for 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1).

2. **Check the Startup Logs**:
   - Look in the kernel logs for the MD5 hash:
     
     ```bash
     dmesg | grep -i boot
     ```
     
     You’ll see a line with a 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash marked for the Boot Log Leak challenge.
   
   - Or, check the system log:
     ```bash
     grep -i boot /var/log/syslog
     ```
     Find the same MD5 hash in the output.

3. **Prepare the Flag**:
   - Copy the MD5 hash from the logs.
   - Utilise this hash to decrypt an archive file to expose the flag.

## What You Learn
- How to use a UART serial console to access a device.
- How to search system logs (`dmesg`, `/var/log/syslog`) for hidden data.
- Why leaking sensitive information in logs is a security risk.

## Notes
- You don’t need to escalate privileges or modify hardware beyond setting up UART.
- UART access works without network connectivity, perfect for this challenge.
- Check the DVRPi documentation for UART pinout, login details, and setup instructions.
