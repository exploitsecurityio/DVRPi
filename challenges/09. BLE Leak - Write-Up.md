# BLE Leak - Write-Up

## Overview
**Challenge Name**: BLE Leak  
**Difficulty**: Low/Intermediate  
**Category**: Wireless/Bluetooth  
**Goal**: Capture a flag advertised via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) by analyzing packets broadcast from a Raspberry Pi.

## What You’ll Need
- Raspberry Pi 4B with BLE capabilities.
- Linux system with BlueZ (.e.g. `hcitool`, `hciconfig`, `btmon`).
- Ubertooth One for external sniffing (optional).
- Wireshark for packet analysis (optional but important).
- Terminal emulator for UART access.

## Challenge Description
A Raspberry Pi advertises a flag via BLE, embedded in the advertisement packet. The provided script (`ble_leak.py`) [running as a system service] and configuration file (`ble_leak.conf`) attempt to broadcast the flag in the Manufacturer Specific Data field (ID `0xFFFF`). The goal is to capture and decode the flag by sniffing BLE packets, overcoming issues like malformed packets and missing traffic.

## How to Solve It
1. **Connect to Pi**:
   - UART (GPIO 4: RX, 6: Ground, 8: TX; 115200 baud)

     ```bash
     `minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200`.
     ```

2. **Capture and Decode Flag**:
   
   - Using `btmon` to sniff packets or another choice of capture utility:
     
     ```bash
     sudo hcitool lescan
     sudo btmon | grep -A 5 "Incomplete List of 128-bit Service UUIDs"
     mkfifo /tmp/pipe <!-- To be used with wireshark capture
     ```

3. Convert advertised data or view within wireshark:

## What You Learn
- BLE advertisement packet structure and configuration.
- Debugging malformed BLE packets using `hcitool` and `btmon`.
- Sniffing BLE traffic with `btmon` and Ubertooth One/Wireshark.
- Handling Bluetooth adapter states and BlueZ quirks.

## Notes
- **Adapter Issues**: Reset the adapter (`hciconfig hci0 reset`) if `EBUSY` or no traffic occurs.
- **BlueZ Version**: Ensure `hcitool` is supported (BlueZ ≤5.50). Check with `bluetoothctl --version`.
- **Ubertooth One**: Cycle channels (`-q 37`, `-q 38`, `-q 39`) if packets are missed.
- **Malformed Packet**: Caused by incorrect length fields in the script’s `adv_data`. Manual commands with precise lengths resolved this.
- **Alternative Tools**: `nRF Connect` mobile app can verify advertisements.
