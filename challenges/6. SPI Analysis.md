# SPI Analysis

## Overview
- **Challenge Name**: SPI Analysis  
- **Difficulty**: Low  
- **Category**: Debugging  
- **Goal**: Capture a clear-text flag transmitted over the DVRPi’s SPI interface using a logic analyser.

The **Damn Vulnerable Raspberry Pi (DVRPi)** leaks a sensitive flag in clear text over its SPI0 interface, a common vulnerability in embedded systems. Your task is to connect a logic analyser to the SPI pins, capture the transmission, decode the flag from the MOSI line. This challenge demonstrates how unencrypted SPI communication can expose critical data.

## What You’ll Need
- A logic analyser (e.g., Saleae Logic, Sigrok-compatible) with at least 4 channels and probe wires.
- A UART-to-USB adapter for DVRPi serial console access (GPIO pins 4, 6, 8 for TX, RX, ground; 115200 baud, 8N1).
- A terminal emulator like `minicom`, `screen`, or PuTTY.
- Basic Linux command-line knowledge (e.g., using `bash`).

## Challenge Description
The DVRPi runs a user-space program that periodically transmits a flag over SPI0 (GPIO 8-11, pins 24, 19, 21, 23). The flag is sent in clear-text ASCII, making it capturable with a logic analyser. Your steps are:

1. Connect to the DVRPi via its UART serial console.
2. Set up a logic analyser to capture SPI communication.
3. Decode the flag from the MOSI line.

This challenge highlights the risks of unencrypted data transmission in embedded systems and teaches hardware debugging techniques.

## How to Solve It
Here’s how to tackle the SPI Analysis challenge:

1. **Connect to the DVRPi via UART**:
   - Connect a UART-to-USB adapter to the DVRPi’s GPIO pins:
     - **TX (GPIO 4, pin 8)** to the adapter’s RX.
     - **RX (GPIO 6, pin 10)** to the adapter’s TX.
     - **Ground (pin 6)** to the adapter’s ground.
   - Configure your terminal emulator (e.g., `minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200` or `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`) for 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1).

2. **Set Up the Logic analyser**:
   - Connect the logic analyser probes to the DVRPi’s SPI pins:
     - **CE0 (GPIO 8, pin 24)**: Chip select signal.
     - **MOSI (pin 19, pin 25)**: Data line (flag transmission).
     - **SCLK (GPIO 11, pin 23)**: Clock signal.
     - **Ground (pin 6)**: Ground reference.
   - Configure the logic analyser software (e.g., Saleae Logic or PulseView):
     - Set SPI mode: CPOL=0, CPHA=0 (Mode 0).
     - Bit order: MSB first.
     - Sampling rate: ≥1 MHz.

3. **Capture the Flag**:
   - Start the logic analyser capture and wait 5-10 seconds to record at least one transmission (flag sent every 5 seconds).
   - Stop the capture and inspect the MOSI channel in the SPI decoder.
   - Look for an ASCII string starting with `flag{` and ending with `}`.
   - Copy the flag string.

## What You Learn
- How to use a logic analyser to capture and decode SPI communication.
- How to access a device via a UART serial console.
- Why unencrypted SPI transmission is a security risk in embedded systems.
- How to use command-line tools to validate challenge flags.

## Notes
- No hardware modifications are needed beyond connecting UART and logic analyser probes.
- UART access works without network connectivity.
- GPIO pin 24 (CE0) may be faulty (~0.35V); test with a multimeter or replace the Pi if issues occur.
